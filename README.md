# QuikGraph

## What is **QuikGraph**?

QuikGraph provides generic directed/undirected graph data structures and algorithms for .NET.

QuikGraph comes with algorithms such as depth first search, breath first search, A* search, shortest path, k-shortest path, maximum flow, minimum spanning tree, etc.

*QuikGraph was originally created by Jonathan "Peli" de Halleux in 2003 and named QuickGraph.*

It was then updated to become YC.QuickGraph.

**This version** of QuikGraph is forked from KeRNeLith/QuikGraph, which is forked from YC.QuickGraph. The goal of this fork is to provide funcitonality for the Unity game engine, including all tests included in KeRNeLith/QuikGraph.
