## Introduction

QuikGraph provides generic directed/undirected graph data structures and algorithms for .NET.

QuikGraph comes with algorithms such as depth first search, breath first search, A* search, shortest path, k-shortest path, maximum flow, minimum spanning tree, etc.

*QuikGraph was originally created by Jonathan "Peli" de Halleux in 2003 and named QuickGraph.*

It was then updated to become YC.QuickGraph.

**This version** of QuickGraph, renamed **QuikGraph**, is a fork of YC.QuickGraph, and I tried to clean the Core of the library to provide it as a clean NuGet package using modern C# development (.NET Core).

The plan would be to fully clean the original library and all its non Core parts and unit test it more.

You can find library sources on [GitHub](https://github.com/KeRNeLith/QuikGraph).
